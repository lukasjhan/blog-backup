## **Introduction**

In today's fast-paced digital world, the reliability and performance of global backends are not just operational concerns; they are business imperatives. As more organizations move towards distributed systems and cloud-based architectures, ensuring the availability and efficiency of these systems becomes a critical challenge. This is where observability plays a pivotal role. Observability isn't just about monitoring what's happening; it's about understanding and predicting the system's behavior and ensuring it can withstand failures and disruptions. This article delves into three key components of observability: Monitoring Systems, Error Tracking, and Resilience & Failover strategies.

## **Monitoring and Alert: The Heartbeat of Backend Servers**

Monitoring and alert systems are the heartbeat of backend infrastructure, providing real-time analytics and alerts on system health and performance. By continuously tracking metrics like server load, response times, and resource utilization, organizations can anticipate issues before they escalate.

### **Best Practices**

* **Emphasis on Data Reliability**: Reliable and accurate data collection is fundamental to the success of any system. It forms the basis for informed decision-making and effective issue resolution.
    
    Server load, response times, and resource utilization must be measured very accurately.
    

* **Proactive Alerting with Historical Data Analysis**: Utilize historical data to empower the system with predictive capabilities. This approach enables the identification and notification of potential issues before they escalate, allowing preemptive action.
    
* **Customization to Mitigate Alert Fatigue**: Implement customization options in the alert system to allow prioritization based on the severity and relevance of issues. This strategy helps in reducing unnecessary noise and focusing on critical alerts.
    
* **Action-Oriented Alert Messages**: Ensure that each alert contains adequate situational information to guide the appropriate response. This includes detailed insights into the nature, location, and potential consequences of the identified issue.
    
    Develop and integrate pre-defined action plans for different types of alerts. This forward planning ensures that teams can respond quickly and effectively, reducing the resolution time and mitigating potential impacts
    
* **Scalability**: As business grows, so should the monitoring system, seamlessly adapting to increased loads.
    

Currently, I receive alerts through Slack, and each of them takes no more than 30 seconds on average and 1 minutes at most to process. Since there is accurate information about the situation and prepared methods, it does not take long to make a decision.

## **Error Tracking: Pinpoint Problem Spots**

Error tracking systems are crucial in identifying, prioritizing, and addressing issues in backend servers. They provide context to errors, helping teams understand the root cause and the impact on users.

### **Best Practices**

* **Contextual Information for Rapid Resolution**: The key to swift problem-solving lies in receiving detailed error reports that provide in-depth context. These reports should clearly identify the specific components impacted by the issue, allowing you to quickly ascertain the order in which the errors are affecting your system. With this clarity, you can prioritize and address the most critical problems first, leading to more efficient and effective resolutions.
    
* **Prioritization of Issues**: Helps focus on fixing errors that impact the most users or critical system functions.
    

Through the Request ID, I can see at a glance where the error occurred and in what order it was propagated. Problem spots can be identified and corrected immediately.

## **3\. Resilience and Failover: The Safety Net**

Resilience and robust in backend servers involves designing systems that can handle and recover from failures seamlessly. It's about ensuring continuous service availability, even under adverse conditions. The key strategies for resilient Systems are **Redundancy, Load Balancing** and **Disaster Recovery Plans**

### **Best Practices**

* **Automated Failover Mechanisms:** Failover mechanisms ensure that in the event of a system failure, the workload is swiftly transferred to backup systems with minimal to no service interruption. Automation in failover processes reduces human error and response time.
    
* **Continuous Testing and Improvement:** Resilience is not a set-and-forget strategy. Regular testing and refinement of failover and recovery processes are essential for adapting to new threats and scenarios.
    

Since there is a mechanism to respond to failures, even if an actual problem occurs, it only takes a few seconds for the problematic server to be isolated and the service to return to normal.

## **Conclusion**

In summary, the observability of global backend servers through robust monitoring, effective error tracking, and resilient failover strategies is fundamental in today's digital landscape. By implementing these strategies, organizations can ensure that their backend infrastructure is not only reliable and performant but also capable of withstanding and recovering from unexpected challenges. Remember, in the realm of global backend servers, observability is not just a tool; it's the lifeline that keeps the digital heartbeat of businesses running smoothly.

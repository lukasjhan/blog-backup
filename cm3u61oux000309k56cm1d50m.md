In the fast-paced world of software-as-a-service (SaaS), performance and reliability are not just goals—they are the benchmarks that define user satisfaction and success. Caching, a seemingly simple yet profoundly impactful strategy, plays a crucial role in achieving these benchmarks. Drawing on my experience with HeartBeat, a status checking and status page generation SaaS, this blog post explores the nuanced art of caching—what to cache, when to cache, and how to manage it effectively.

## **When is Caching Appropriate?**

Caching serves as a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the data's primary storage location. In the context of HeartBeat, caching is indispensable. It accelerates access to frequently requested service statuses, making the system more responsive and efficient. Caching shines in scenarios where:

* **The cost (time or resources) to retrieve data is high.**
    
    HeartBeat's status information is created and stored around the world. And it must be delivered to users around the world. Therefore, the process of retrieving data is very expensive.
    
* **Data is read frequently but modified infrequently.**
    
    What users around the world check are records created in the past. Whether the server is healthy or not. Therefore, our service experiences a very high read load. However, new data is just being added. There are almost no cases of modification.
    
* **The demand for quick data access is critical to user experience.**
    
    When a customer's service does not work due to a problem with the server status, the first thing users around the world access is the status page. They are currently experiencing a problem and want to quickly determine the cause of the problem and resolve it. It is important that our service delivers fast and accurate information to them.
    

## **What Data Should Be Cached?**

Identifying the right data to cache is critical. For HeartBeat, this means caching the status information of services that users check frequently. Such data has a high read rate and changes relatively slowly, making it ideal for caching. The goal is to cache data that enhances performance while ensuring it remains fresh and relevant.

## **How and When Does Cached Data Expire?**

Managing the lifecycle of cached data is vital to maintaining its effectiveness. Using expiration policies like Time to Live (TTL) and Least Recently Used (LRU) ensures that data remains current without manual intervention. In HeartBeat, TTL can be applied to status information, ensuring that only the most recent statuses are cached. We display detailed information on the status page for up to 24 hours. Therefore, we use 24 hours as the TTL for detailed data. Additionally, average statistical data is shown on a one-year basis. We calculate this information by date and use 365 days as TTL.

## **How is Cache Consistency Maintained to Handle Cache Failures?**

Cache consistency is essential for maintaining the integrity of the data served to users. HeartBeat employs a combination of strategies. The cache server periodically calculates the hash value for a certain chunk of data and compares it with the original data. If the data is not the same at this time, invalidate the cache and update it. This operation is responsible for recovering the consistency of the cache system from failures.

Cache failures can degrade performance and user experience. By implementing robust error-handling mechanisms and fallback strategies, HeartBeat ensures continuous service availability.

## **What to Evict When Cache Space is Full?**

Deciding which data to evict when space runs out is crucial for maintaining cache effectiveness. HeartBeat uses 3 types of cache data. We operate a cache that suits its characteristics.

1. **Compressed cache with long TTL: Past statistical data**
    
2. **Short TTL applied cache: Recent server status.**
    
3. **LRU applied cache: Failure situation information.**
    

## **Conclusion**

The strategic implementation of caching in HeartBeat has been a cornerstone of its ability to provide fast, reliable service status checks. By carefully selecting what data to cache, managing its lifecycle, maintaining consistency, preparing for failures, and intelligently managing cache space, HeartBeat demonstrates the power of caching in enhancing SaaS performance. For developers and architects, the lessons from HeartBeat underscore the importance of a thoughtful approach to caching—one that balances technical considerations with user needs to deliver superior service experiences.

## A Year of Global Identity Conversations

2024 marked a significant year in my professional journey as I had the privilege of attending both sessions of the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in San Francisco - in April and October. These workshops proved to be more than just technical conferences; they were vibrant hubs of innovation, collaboration, and cross-cultural exchange in the digital identity space.

## The Power of Open Dialogue

What makes IIW truly unique is its unconventional format. Instead of traditional presentations, the workshop embraces an open, collaborative approach to solving complex technical challenges. This format creates an environment where:

* Ideas flow freely between participants
    
* Solutions emerge through collective wisdom
    
* Different perspectives challenge existing assumptions
    
* Innovation happens organically through discussion
    

## Global Perspectives on Digital Identity

One of the most enriching aspects of IIW was the exposure to various international approaches to digital identity. Each country's unique challenges and solutions provided valuable insights into the global identity landscape. Our team had the opportunity to share South Korea's innovative approach, particularly our esports use case, which generated significant interest among participants.

### Spotlight on Our Innovation

The enthusiastic response to our esports use case presentation highlighted how different industries can leverage digital identity solutions in unexpected ways. The intersection of gaming, identity, and security sparked fascinating discussions about potential applications in other sectors.

## Mobile Driving License (MDL): A Growing Focus

A notable trend across both workshops was the increasing emphasis on Mobile Driving License technology. The depth and breadth of MDL-related discussions have inspired new directions for our future work. The potential applications and implications of MDL technology present exciting opportunities for innovation in the digital identity space.

## Personal Growth Through Global Exchange

These workshops provided more than just technical knowledge; they offered:

* Exposure to diverse problem-solving approaches
    
* Opportunities to challenge and refine existing ideas
    
* Valuable networking with global identity experts
    
* Fresh perspectives on familiar challenges
    

## Looking Forward

The experiences and insights gained from IIW have shaped both my understanding of digital identity and my vision for future projects. The focus on MDL technology, in particular, has opened new avenues for exploration and innovation in our work.

## Conclusion

The Internet Identity Workshop represents more than just a conference - it's a testament to the power of collaborative problem-solving and open dialogue in advancing digital identity solutions. As we move forward with our projects, particularly in the MDL space, the lessons and connections made at IIW will continue to influence and inform our approach.

*The journey through IIW 2024 has reinforced that the future of digital identity lies not just in technical solutions, but in the power of global collaboration and open dialogue.*

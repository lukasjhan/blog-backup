## **Introduction**

Developing a standard library, such as the ['sd-jwt' library](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/sd-jwt-js) I recently crafted, is a meticulous process that forms the foundation of efficient software development. This blog post aims to explore the vital elements involved in this process: adhering to standards, ensuring robustness and resilience, fostering interoperability, and providing user-friendly documentation.

## **Understanding and Adhering to Standards**

A fundamental aspect of building a standard library is a deep understanding of key terms like "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT," "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "NOT RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL." These terms guide the implementation process:

* "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT" indicate non-negotiable features that your library must implement.
    
* "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "NOT RECOMMENDED" imply features with default values that can be overwritten based on specific needs.
    
* "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" refer to features that provide additional, non-essential functionality.
    

Understanding these directives is crucial for compliance with the standards and for shaping the functionality and scope of the library.

## **The Backbone of Library Development**

Robustness and resilience are the cornerstones of any standard library, especially when it becomes an integral part of larger software systems. The 'sd-jwt' library, for instance, was developed with these principles in mind.

Ensuring completeness and extensive testing coverage is not just a goal but a necessity. These practices result in a library that serves as the backbone of software development, marked by outstanding quality and reliability.

## **Ensuring Interoperability**

Interoperability is key in standard library development. Regular communication with developers of other language libraries, sharing test suites, and checking basic interfaces are essential practices. This collaborative approach not only enhances the library’s compatibility with various systems but also ensures that it meets the diverse needs of the user community.

## **User-Friendly Documentation**

Finally, user-friendly documentation is a must. This includes:

* Detailed API documentation that clearly explains each function and its usage.
    
* Practical examples that illustrate common use cases and guide users through complex scenarios.
    
* Comprehensive guides that help new users get started and experienced users to exploit advanced features.
    

In writing these documents, maintaining consistency with the standard documentation in terms of variable names, keywords, and terms is imperative and crucial. This consistency ensures that users, whether they are beginners or advanced, can easily follow the documentation and apply the library effectively in their projects.

## **Conclusion**

In building a standard library, understanding key considerations, ensuring robustness and resilience, fostering interoperability, and providing comprehensive documentation are non-negotiable elements. These considerations were central to the development of the ['sd-jwt' library](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation-labs/sd-jwt-js?utm_source=vertex.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=building-standard-opensource-libraries-key-considerations) and are essential for any library that aims to be a fundamental part of the software development ecosystem.

## **Community Engagement**

I encourage the community to share their experiences and insights related to standard library development. Whether it’s about adherence to standards, overcoming challenges in ensuring robustness, or effective documentation strategies, your contributions are invaluable in fostering a shared pool of knowledge and advancing the field.

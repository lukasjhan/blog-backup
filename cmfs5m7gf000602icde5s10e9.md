Speed and collaboration are the lifeblood of startups. Yet sometimes, a developer's problematic attitudes can hold back the entire team. Today, I want to share the toxic behaviors I've witnessed in startups and how we can fix them.

## 1\. Passive Attitude: "I Only Do What I'm Told"

### The Problem

Nothing is more fatal in a startup than hearing "That's not my job." Passive developers only execute explicit instructions, refusing to see the bigger picture. They spot bugs but think "Not my code, not my problem." They have improvement ideas but never share them.

### The Right Direction

**Take ownership.** Every startup member is a mini-CEO. Even when writing a single line of code, ask yourself: "What value does this bring to our product and users?" When you spot problems, present them with solutions. When you see better ways, speak up actively.

## 2\. The Perfectionism Trap: "I Can't Start Until Everything Is 100% Ready"

### The Problem

"The requirements aren't fully clear yet," "How can I start when the design isn't perfect?" "We'll probably have to change this later anyway..."

Some developers live by these excuses. In startups, 100% perfect planning doesn't exist. Markets change daily, user feedback is unpredictable, and the product itself is a hypothesis. While waiting for perfection, competitors pass you by and opportunities disappear forever.

### The Right Direction

**Execute at 70% readiness, improve the rest as you go.** The startup mantra is 'Build-Measure-Learn.' Creating an MVP quickly and getting market feedback beats launching a "perfect" product a year later by a hundredfold.

You need the mindset of "Let's start with this and fix problems as they come." You can always refactor later, but missed opportunities never return.

## 3\. Communication Breakdown: "My Way Is Best"

### The Problem

The most frustrating moments:

* The team decides on A in a meeting, but someone builds B anyway
    
* When given feedback, responding with "You just don't understand"
    
* Taking help for granted without expressing gratitude
    
* Sulking and doing sloppy work when their opinion isn't accepted
    

These attitudes destroy team trust and make collaboration impossible.

### The Right Direction

**Listening and respect are fundamental.** First, hear others out completely. If you disagree, try: "That's a good perspective, but what if we also consider this aspect?" And when someone helps you, express genuine gratitude. Small thank-yous transform team dynamics entirely.

## 4\. Information Hoarding: "I'll Keep It to Myself"

### The Problem

Disasters created by developers who don't share information:

* Deadline bombshells: "Oh, actually I don't think I can finish this"
    
* Delivering something completely different from requirements
    
* Only reporting progress when explicitly asked
    
* Struggling alone with problems until missing deadlines
    

### The Right Direction

**Practice transparent communication:**

* Share honest progress updates in daily standups
    
* Ask for help immediately when stuck
    
* Alert the team early about schedule changes
    
* Document your work and share with the team
    

Saying "I need help" isn't weakness. It's professionalism.

## 5\. Lack of Accountability: "It's Not My Fault"

### The Problem

Developers who make excuses first, who blame others first, block the team's growth. "QA didn't catch it," "The specs weren't clear," "There wasn't enough time"â€”these excuses don't solve problems.

### The Right Direction

**Own your mistakes and learn.** When problems arise, have the courage to say: "I missed something there. Here's how I'll improve going forward." Mistakes are growth opportunities. What matters is not repeating them.

## Final Thoughts: Attitude Determines Ability

In startups, the right attitude often matters more than exceptional coding skills. A growth mindset, open communication, and ownership. These create healthy development cultures.

Startups especially must move fast amid uncertainty. Rather than losing opportunities while pursuing perfection, we need to start now and rapidly iterate.

None of us are perfect. But we can strive to become better developers and better teammates. Why not start making small changes today?

Small attitude shifts create team-wide success. Let's build a better development culture together.

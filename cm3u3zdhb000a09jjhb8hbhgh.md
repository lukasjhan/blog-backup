## **Introduction**

In the dynamic world of web development, one fundamental principle remains constant: for SaaS products, JavaScript-based SDKs, or libraries, the code must be served in raw JavaScript files accessible via script tags. This fundamental tenet ensures wide compatibility and ease of integration across various web platforms. Despite this foundational aspect, integrating these global JavaScript SDKs with modern UI frameworks, such as React, has presented unique challenges. Specifically, the synchronization of React's lifecycle with global objects, such as `window`, has historically required complex and less-than-ideal solutions. However, the release of React v18 heralds a new era in this domain. This post explores how the latest React features, particularly `useSyncExternalStore`, are revolutionizing the integration of SDKs into React applications, making it a smoother, more efficient process.

## **The Traditional Approach: Challenges and Limitations**

In the past, the integration of a global SDK into React components often necessitated the use of the global object (`window`). Developers had to resort to this method to create a bridge between the SDK and React components, as illustrated in the following example:

```plaintext
const Provider = ({ children }) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState({
    // initial state
  });

  // Update functions
  window.sdk.setProject = (project) => {
    setData(prev => ({ ...prev, project }));
  };
  // More update functions
};
```

However, this method was fraught with challenges:

1. **Global Scope Pollution:** Utilizing the global object could lead to naming conflicts and difficulties in maintenance.
    
2. **State Management Complexity:** The need for manual synchronization between the SDK and React components was often error-prone and convoluted.
    

## **The New Paradigm with React v18**

React v18 introduces a game-changing hook, `useSyncExternalStore`, which simplifies the process of synchronizing external stores with React's state management. This approach brings several advantages, as shown in the example below:

```plaintext
function App() {
  const data = useSyncExternalStore(
    mySDKStore.subscribe,
    mySDKStore.getSnapshot
  );

  return (
    // UI components using data
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>{data.label}</p>
    ...
  );
}
```

### **Benefits of** `useSyncExternalStore`

* **Streamlined Integration:** It integrates the SDK seamlessly, as if it were a native part of React's ecosystem.
    
* **Reduced Complexity:** By avoiding manipulation of the global scope, the codebase becomes more maintainable and cleaner.
    
* **Optimized Performance:** React updates components efficiently based on changes in the external store, ensuring better performance.
    

## **Practical Applications**

This approach is especially beneficial in scenarios like multi-tenant SaaS applications, where global user preferences and configurations need to be reflected in real-time across various UI components.

## **Best Practices and Common Pitfalls**

While `useSyncExternalStore` offers a more straightforward approach, it's important to adhere to best practices such as avoiding over-subscription and keeping SDK logic separate from UI components for better modularity.

## **Conclusion**

The advent of `useSyncExternalStore` in React v18 is a significant milestone in integrating JavaScript SDKs with React UI components. It represents a move towards more efficient, cleaner, and maintainable web applications. This innovation is a testament to the ever-evolving nature of web development, continually enhancing our ability to create robust, user-friendly applications.

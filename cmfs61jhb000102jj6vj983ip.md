In an era of accelerating digital transformation, the OpenWallet Forum successfully held its first High-Level Panel Event on January 22, 2025, in Davos, Switzerland, setting a new milestone for digital trust and global interoperability. Hosted by the Swiss Confederation and jointly organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the OpenWallet Foundation/Linux Foundation, this event brought together key stakeholders to discuss the critical need for interoperability in digital wallets and credentials.

## July's Historic Gathering: Global Digital Collaboration

The OpenWallet Foundation is co-hosting the '[Global Digital Collaboration](https://globaldigitalcollaboration.org/)' event on July 1-2, 2025, in Geneva, Switzerland, alongside over 30 organizations.

As an open source maintainer, I'm very excited about the potential for diverse use case collaborations through this event.

## Interoperability and Future Prospects

The Government Advisory Council (GAC) currently has 10 countries participating. The participation of such diverse nations in such a short time is truly impressive.

The OpenWallet Foundation's interoperability approach ensures user choice, security, and privacy while operating on a global scale.

The July 1-2 Global Digital Collaboration will be **a major stepping stone for digital identity adoption and interoperability**.

## Conclusion: Toward a Trustworthy Digital Future

The efforts of the OpenWallet Forum and Foundation go beyond simply creating technical standards. They are fostering an internationally aligned ecosystem that provides trustworthy, open, and inclusive tools for a safe and sound global economy.

The Geneva event in July will be more than just a conference. It will be a historic moment opening a new era of digital trust. At the center of this future of digital identity that the world is creating together are the OpenWallet Forum and Foundation.

**The future of digital identity depends on interoperability. And that future is starting now.**

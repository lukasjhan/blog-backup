Last week, I had the opportunity to present our team's implementation work on SD-JWT VCLD at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW). This was a particularly meaningful experience as we were able to share real-world implementer feedback on a key component of the OpenID4VP standard.

## The IIW Presentation

Our team has been working on implementing SD-JWT VCLD, which is specified in the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP) standard.

During our session at IIW, we focused on:

* **Implementation challenges** we encountered while building our SD-JWT VCLD solution
    
* **Technical feedback** that could help improve the standard
    

The discussion that followed was invaluable. Fellow implementers and standards experts shared their perspectives, and we engaged in productive debates about edge cases and potential improvements to the specification.

We also participated in the speed demo session, which was a great opportunity to showcase our implementation in action. Being able to demonstrate the actual working code alongside our feedback made our points more concrete and relatable.

## OpenID Working Group Meeting at Infinite Loop

The following day brought an exciting opportunity - participating in an OpenID Working Group meeting held at Apple's Infinite Loop campus. Being part of these technical discussions in person added a new dimension to our involvement in the standards community. The face-to-face format enabled deeper technical discussions and helped build stronger connections within the working group.

## Closing Thoughts

This experience reinforced the importance of implementer feedback in standards development. By building real implementations and sharing our experiences, we contribute to making these standards more robust and practical for widespread adoption.

It was truly exciting to contribute directly to standards development, and I want to express my appreciation to everyone working passionately to create better standards. Looking forward to continuing this journey and contributing more!

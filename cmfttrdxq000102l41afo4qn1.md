I recently had the opportunity to participate in IATA's (International Air Transport Association) Data & Tech PoC Workshop in Montreal. It was a meaningful gathering where we discussed practical innovations for the aviation industry and explored ways to bring them to life.

## Meeting Diverse Industry Stakeholders

What struck me most about the workshop was the opportunity to meet representatives from various airlines and aviation industry companies. Seeing participants from different backgrounds and expertise come together to discuss common goals truly demonstrated the industry's collaborative spirit.

## Digital Identity Technology: From Theory to Reality

The core focus of this workshop was **Digital Identity Technology**. Rather than merely discussing technical possibilities, we engaged in concrete and realistic discussions about how this technology could solve actual problems facing the aviation industry.

Ideas flowed about revolutionizing the complex and time-consuming processes from passenger identity verification to security screening and boarding procedures. The focus was particularly intense on finding solutions that could achieve both improved passenger experience and enhanced operational efficiency.

## Real-World Barriers and Implementation Challenges

However, the path to innovation was far from smooth. Beyond technical feasibility, there were numerous real-world barriers to overcome for actual implementation:

* **Legacy System Complexity**: The compatibility issues with existing systems built over decades proved to be the biggest obstacle. With each airline and airport using different systems, integrating new digital identity technology required far more complexity than simply adding new technology.
    
* **Varying Privacy Regulations by Country**: What particularly impressed me was how personal data protection laws differ slightly from country to country. There was a real dilemma in satisfying GDPR and each nation's unique privacy regulations while providing seamless international aviation services.
    
* **Balancing Security and Convenience**: Finding the equilibrium between enhanced security and passenger convenience
    
* **Cost and Investment**: The enormous economic burden of industry-wide infrastructure changes
    

## Understanding Aviation Industry Realities

Through this workshop, I gained a deeper understanding of the aviation industry's complex ecosystem. I came to appreciate the industry's unique characteristics, that it's not simply about implementing technology, but rather meeting the multifaceted requirements of safety, security, efficiency, and customer experience all at once.

Particularly, given the aviation industry's nature requiring international cooperation, I realized that innovation by individual companies alone has its limitations. True transformation requires industry-wide collaboration and standardized approaches.

## The Journey Until April 2025

This project is scheduled to continue until April next year. I'm genuinely excited and thrilled about the possibility of contributing to aviation industry innovation through this journey over the coming months.

Beyond simply developing technology, being able to contribute to solving real industry problems and improving passenger experiences brings great satisfaction.

## Closing Thoughts

Those few days in Montreal were truly precious. I was able to witness firsthand the efforts to bridge the gap between technology and reality, and the industry's passion for creating better aviation experiences.

I hope to continue participating in such meaningful projects, contributing to the digital transformation of the aviation industry. I want technology to become a tool that goes beyond simple innovation to actually improve people's lives.

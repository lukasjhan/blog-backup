As digital transformation accelerates across every sector of our lives, we're witnessing an unprecedented shift toward online interactions. From banking and healthcare to education and commerce, virtually every aspect of our daily activities is becoming digitized. In this rapidly evolving landscape, **digital identity** has emerged as a critical foundation for our connected world.

However, for digital identity systems to function effectively, one element stands above all others: **trust**. We need reliable mechanisms to verify that digital credentials, certificates, and attestations are authentic and issued by trustworthy authorities.

## The Current Challenge: Fragmented Trust Systems

Today's digital identity ecosystem suffers from severe fragmentation. Organizations and platforms have built their own isolated trust mechanisms, resulting in a landscape where interoperability between different systems is virtually non-existent.

Consider this common scenario: a digital diploma issued by a Korean university cannot be automatically verified by a German company's hiring system, or professional credentials from Canada remain unrecognizable to employers in Singapore. Each country has developed its own national digital identity framework with distinct technical standards and trust models, creating significant barriers that limit cross-border recognition and the global utility of digital credentials.

## The Solution: Open Trust Infrastructure Like DNS

To address this challenge, we need **universally accessible and interoperable trust infrastructure, similar to how DNS (Domain Name System) works**. Just as DNS serves as the foundational infrastructure that enables the internet to function seamlessly across the globe, digital identity trust systems require an open, standardized approach.

### The Power of Open Source

The most effective path to building such infrastructure lies in **open source development**. This approach offers compelling advantages:

* **Transparency**: Open code allows anyone to audit and verify the system's integrity
    
* **Accessibility**: No vendor lock-in ensures universal access and adoption
    
* **Innovation**: Global developer collaboration accelerates advancement and improvement
    
* **Security**: Community review strengthens security through collective scrutiny
    

## Standardization Efforts: Trust Registry Query Protocol

In this context, the work of organizations developing standards like the **Trust Registry Query Protocol** becomes crucial. These protocols provide essential capabilities:

* Verification of digital credential issuing authorities
    
* Standardized methods for querying trust information
    
* Interoperability guarantees between diverse systems
    
* Foundation for scalable, distributed trust networks
    

## Building the Foundation for Tomorrow

The importance of trust services in digital identity systems extends far beyond security considerations. This infrastructure represents the backbone of digital societyâ€”the key that ensures equitable access to digital services for everyone.

When we establish open and interoperable trust infrastructure, we unlock tremendous potential:

* **For individuals**: Safer, more convenient management of digital identities
    
* **For businesses**: More efficient and reliable service delivery
    
* **For society**: Reduced digital divides and enhanced inclusivity
    

## Looking Ahead

Just as DNS enabled the internet's explosive growth and global adoption, standardized and open digital identity trust infrastructure will serve as the foundation for the next generation of digital society. Achieving this vision requires not only technical standard development but also sustained collaboration among diverse stakeholders and continued commitment from open source communities.

The trust infrastructure we build today will serve as the bedrock of digital society for decades to come. This is precisely why it's essential to design these systems with openness and universal access as core principles from the very beginning.
